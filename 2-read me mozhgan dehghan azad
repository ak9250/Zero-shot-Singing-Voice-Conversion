we have proposed AUTOVC, a non-parallel voice conversion algorithm that significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art, and that is the first to perform zero-shot conversions. In sharp contrast to its performance advantage is its simple autoencoder structure that trains only on self-reconstruction, and a bottleneck tuning to balance between reconstruction quality and speaker disentanglement. In an era of building increasingly sophisticated algorithms for style transfer, our theoretical justification and the success of AUTOVC suggest that it is time to return to simplicity, because sometimes an autoencoder with a careful bottleneck design is all you need to make a difference
